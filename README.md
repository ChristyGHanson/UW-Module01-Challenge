# User Story
 In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

 To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. 
 
 * For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. 
 * Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
 * Include comments before each element or section of the page.

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:

* WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.

* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

* WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.

* WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order.

* WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
