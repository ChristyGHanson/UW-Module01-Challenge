# UW Module 01 Challenge
## Code Refactor Starter Code
* FINISHED - I cloned and copied my starter code to my local folder.

## Relevant Links I Used for this Module 01 Challenge
1. mdn webdocs HTML and Accessibility: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML

2. w3schools - Semantic Elements in HTML (SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM): https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

3. mdn Selector (CSS): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_Selector

## User Story
 In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. 
 
 * For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. 
 * Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
 * Include comments before each element or section of the page.

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:
* FINISHED: I checked to make sure anchor tags are functioning properly.

*FINISHED: I enclosed as many comments as I could to describe my HTML refactoring tasks. 

* FINISHED: Semantic HTML tags are enclosed.

* FINISHED: HTML elements are in place as far as I can tell.

*FINISHED: Accessible alt attribute descriptions are enclosed in the img attributes for the articles. I left the alt attributes blank for the <aside> section on the right-hand margin of the webpage since they were only for decoration.

* FINISHED: My heading attributes were changed to follow sequential order.

* FINISHED: The title element in the HTML file now reads "Homepage for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc."

## My Issues with Module 01 Challenge
* I minimally reworked the CSS. I consolidated once on line 33 in the CSS file. 
* Line 18 of style.css: I changed the font color for the "Horiseon" header that is visible on the webpage. I had edited the HTML file to make the words lighter and more accessible. I also deleted the <span> tag associated with the title and made the words all one color. I did not consider changing the color of the letters "seo" because it would be less accessible to users who are viewing the website.
